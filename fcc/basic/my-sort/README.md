## My Sort

Write a `mySort` function which takes in an array integers, and should return an array of the inputed integers sorted such that the odd numbers come first and even numbers come last.

Example:

```
Input: mySort([90, 45, 66, 'bye', 100.5])
Output: [45, 66, 90, 100]

```

Test Results:

```
mySort( [2,1] ) Should return an Array

mySort( [90, 45, 66] ) should return [45, 66, 90]

mySort( [90, 45, 66, 'bye', 100.5] ) should ignore random strings, treat input as integers, and return [45, 66, 90, 100]

mySort( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] ) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]

```
