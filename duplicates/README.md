## Find Duplicates in an Array

Example:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2]

```

## Non-duplicates

Given a non-empty array of integers every element appears three-times except for one. Find which appears exactly once.

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 99]
Output: 99

```

**Note**:

Your algorithm should have a linear run-time complexity. Implement it without using extra memeory
